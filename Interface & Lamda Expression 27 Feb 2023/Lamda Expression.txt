1. What is the lambda expression of Java 8?
Ans : A lambda expression in Java 8 is a concise way to express an anonymous function (a function without a name). It allows you to write more compact code by providing a clear and expressive syntax for representing functionalities as method arguments.

2. Can you pass lambda expressions to a method? When?
Ans : Yes, you can pass lambda expressions as arguments to methods in Java. This is particularly useful when methods accept functional interfaces as parameters. Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method, and lambda expressions can be used to provide a concise implementation of that method.

3. What is the functional interface in Java 8?
Ans : A functional interface in Java 8 is an interface that contains only one abstract method. It may also contain default or static methods, but the presence of a single abstract method is crucial. Functional interfaces provide a target for lambda expressions and method references. Examples include `Runnable`, `Callable`, and the new functional interfaces introduced in the `java.util.function` package, such as `Consumer`, `Function`, and `Predicate`.

4. Why do we use lambda expressions in Java?
Ans : Lambda expressions in Java provide a more concise and expressive way to write code, especially when dealing with functional programming constructs. They are commonly used to implement functional interfaces, making code more readable and reducing the need for anonymous classes. Lambda expressions enable a more natural representation of behavior as data, promoting a functional programming style and facilitating the use of the Stream API for processing collections in a more declarative manner.

5. Is it mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters?
Ans : No, it is not mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters. Lambda expressions can be parameterless or can take one or more parameters. The syntax for a parameterless lambda expression is `() -> expression`, and for a lambda expression with parameters, it is `(parameters) -> expression`. The choice depends on the specific requirements of the functional interface being used.
