1. What is the default value of Array for different data types?
Ans : The default values in Java arrays are:
     - Numeric types (byte, short, int, long, float, double): 0
     - boolean type: false
     - char type: '\u0000' (null character)
     - Reference types (objects and Strings): null

2. Can you pass a negative number as Array size?
Ans : No, it's not possible to pass a negative number as the size of an array in Java. The size must be a non-negative integer; otherwise, it will result in a runtime exception.

3. Where does Array store in JVM memory?
Ans : Arrays in Java are objects and are stored in the heap memory, the part of JVM memory reserved for the runtime allocation of objects.

4. What are the disadvantages of Array?
Ans : Some drawbacks of arrays include:
     - Fixed size: Cannot dynamically resize once initialized.
     - Lack of flexibility: Inability to easily add or remove elements without creating a new array.
     - Homogeneity: All elements must be of the same data type.

5. What is an Anonymous Array in Java? Give an example.
Ans : An anonymous array is an array without a name, mainly used for immediate array creation and initialization. Example:
    
     int[] numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
     
     Here, "new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }" represents an anonymous array.

6. What are the different ways to traverse an Array in Java?
Ans : Various ways to traverse an array:
     - Using a for loop: "for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // access arr[i] }"
     - Using an enhanced for loop (for-each loop): "for (int element : arr) { // access element }"
     - Using Java 8 Streams: "Arrays.stream(arr).forEach(element -> { // access element });"

7. What is the difference between length and length() method? Give Examples.
Ans : "length" is a property of arrays used to find the number of elements, e.g., "int[] arr = new int[5]; int size = arr.length;"
      "length()" is a method used to find the length of a string in Java, e.g., "String str = "Hello"; int length = str.length();"
