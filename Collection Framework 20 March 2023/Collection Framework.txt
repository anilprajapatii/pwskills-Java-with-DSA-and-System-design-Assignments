1. What is the Collection framework in Java?
Ans : - The Java Collection framework is a set of interfaces, classes, and algorithms provided by Java to manipulate and store groups of objects. It provides a standardized way to handle various types of collections such as lists, sets, queues, etc.

2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Ans :    - ArrayList and LinkedList are both implementations of the List interface.
   - ArrayList uses a dynamic array to store elements, providing fast random access but slower insertion and deletion operations.
   - LinkedList uses a doubly-linked list, offering fast insertion and deletion but slower random access.

3. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
 Ans :   - Iterator is a universal interface for iterating over any Collection. It supports only forward iteration.
   - ListIterator is a subinterface of Iterator and is specific to Lists. It allows bidirectional traversal, enabling both forward and backward movement.

4. What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Ans :    - Iterator is part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to iterate over collections. It supports both read and remove operations.
   - Enumeration is an older interface that was part of the original Collections framework. It only supports read operations and is not as versatile as Iterator.

5. What is the difference between List and Set?
Ans :    - List is an ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Elements can be accessed by their index.
   - Set is an unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements. It ensures uniqueness.

6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
 Ans :   - HashSet is an implementation of the Set interface. It does not maintain any order and allows at most one null element. It offers constant time for basic operations.
   - TreeSet is also an implementation of the Set interface. It maintains elements in sorted order, either using their natural order or a specified comparator.

7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Ans :    - Array is a fixed-size data structure that stores elements of the same type. Once created, the size cannot be changed.
   - ArrayList is a dynamic array implementation of the List interface. It allows dynamic resizing, and elements can be easily added or removed.
